# Pathfinding Visualizer: Your Gateway to Algorithmic Exploration

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer, where algorithms meet visual brilliance! This application is not just a tool; it's a fun and engaging experience that allows you to see how different algorithms navigate and find the best paths. I created this because I'm fascinated by how these algorithms work, and I hope you'll enjoy playing around with them as much as I enjoyed building this.

## Discover the Algorithms

Check out the cool algorithms you can play with:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted):** The OG of pathfinding, always finds the shortest path.
  
2. **A* Search (weighted):** A super-smart algorithm that uses heuristics for a quicker path than Dijkstra's.

3. **Greedy Best-first Search (weighted):** A faster version of A* but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

4. **Swarm Algorithm (weighted):** Like a mix of Dijkstra's and A*; doesn't always give the shortest path.

5. **Convergent Swarm Algorithm (weighted):** A faster version of Swarm, still doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

6. **Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm (weighted):** Swarm from both sides; doesn't guarantee the shortest path.

7. **Breath-first Search (unweighted):** Reliable and always finds the shortest path.

8. **Depth-first Search (unweighted):** Not the best for finding the shortest path but adds an interesting twist.

## The Story of Swarm Algorithm

Ever heard of the Swarm Algorithm? It's a cool creation developed with my friend Hussein Farah. Think of it like a blend of Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Search â€“ finding the best path while exploring nearby nodes. We named it "Swarm" because it could be handy in a video game where you track a boss while dealing with swarming enemies.

This isn't just a pathfinding visualizer; it's your ticket to a fun and educational journey through the world of algorithms. Dive in, experiment, and let the algorithms weave their magic before your eyes!
